## Homework 7-2

Objective: Modify code and connect ```CH0```(甲班)/```CH2```(乙班) to oscilloscope, and use ```CH1```(甲班)/```CH3```(乙班) to control SG90.

Hint:

1. Connect ```CH0```(甲班)/```CH2```(乙班) to oscilloscope.
2. Connect ```CH1```(甲班)/```CH3```(乙班) to servo motor SG90, and rotate it to 0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees angle.
3. Edit code in files: ```main.c``` & ```PWM.h```.

<details><summary>Experiment Steps: (Click to see more)</summary>

1. Modify code.
   1. pwm.h
      1. Adjust ```HTCFG_PWM_TM_PRESCALER``` to make $\cfrac{48MHz}{50\times HTCFG\_PWM\_TM\_PRESCALER}<65536$.
      2. Adjust ```HTCFG_PWM_FREQ_HZ``` to 50.
      3. Add new macro ```PWM_DUTY_0``` ~ ```PWM_DUTY100``` according to PPT.
   2. main.c
      1. Modify code to switch to different ```PWM_DUTY``` one by one.
2. Connect wires.
   1. ```CH0```(甲班)/```CH2```(乙班) :arrow_right: oscilloscope.
   2. ```CH1```(甲班)/```CH3```(乙班) :arrow_right: servo motor SG90 orange wire.
   3. 5V :arrow_right: servo motor SG90 red wire.
   4. GND :arrow_right: servo motor SG90 brown wire.
3. After powered on and loaded with modified code, signal with different duty cycle should appear on oscilloscope and SG90 should rotate accordingly.
