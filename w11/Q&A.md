# Q&A

## 1. UART Connection Speed (Baud Rate)

Q: Can two device with different baud rate (ex, 9600/115200) communicate?  
A: No, needs to be the same.

## 2. Control High Power (High Voltage/Current)

Q: How can I control a fan with MCU?  
A: Use either GPIO or PWM signal to control some kind of switch, like ```Relay``` or ```MOSFET```. These switches takes input current from DC power supply and export to your fan or any other high power device.

## 3. How to find compatible device to connect

Q: I want to connect to a smoke sensor. How?  
A: Find it's communication protocol (UART, SPI, I2C...) with their datasheet. You can search them online. Be sure to check it's power requirement like voltage and current.

## 4. How to use another USART for Bluetooth comm?

Q: How can I use a Bluetooth module (USART/UART protocol) at the same time with displaying debugging info on Tera Term?  
A: Refer to settings in ```./example/USART/Interrupt```, and use USART0 instead of USART1 for Bluetooth module communication. (With specified PIN in datasheet)
